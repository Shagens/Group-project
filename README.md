## USER STORY

As a person new to town, I want to be able to find local Breweries to fit my needs, or be able to find entertaintment for fun, so that I am able to discover new places and meet new people!

## DESCRIPTION

We want to create a user-friendly application that will allow users moving to a new area, or looking for more to do in their area, find bars and other forms of entertainment in their geographical areas. Our goal is to help people find fun and safe ways to engage with others in their community.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

We added a modal to the introduction screen to introduce the user to our application.

We then incorporated a function that fetched the ticketmaster and brewery data, from their respective API's, when the user types in their zip code to find social events and breweries around them.

Implemented an if statement that displays an error message if the area code typed into the search box is invalid.

Created a varibale that would display the data in a readable and easy to navigate manner for the user on the web page.
